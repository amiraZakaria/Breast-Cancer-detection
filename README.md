# Breast-Cancer-detection

Classfication using regression ML algorithm applied to Breast Cancer dataset to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant

# Description 

1-Programming language: R

2-data cleaning and preparation.

3-Built a Statistical model to detect whether the patient has Malignant or Benign tumor.

4-Visualized Training data and testing data 

5-Accuracy 

# Dataset information 

## The dataset consists of the following fields :

1. Sample code number: id number
2. Clump Thickness: 1 - 10
3-Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 - 10
4-Uniformity of Cell Shape: 1 - 10
5-Marginal Adhesion: 1 - 10
6-Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 - 10
7-Bare Nuclei: 1 - 10
8-Bland Chromatin: 1 - 10
9-Normal Nucleoli: 1 - 10
10-Mitoses: 1 - 10
11-Class: (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)

There are 699 instances and each containing information on 9 features of the tumor. The last field is the Class field specifying which class the tumor belongs to.
